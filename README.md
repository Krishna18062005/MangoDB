# Research Paper Summary Project

This repository contains a Python-based application designed to automate the summarization of research papers. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the tool extracts key information from research articles, providing concise summaries to assist researchers and students in quickly understanding the core content of academic papers.

## Features

- **Automatic Summarization**: Generates concise summaries of research papers, highlighting essential information.
- **Keyword Extraction**: Identifies and extracts significant keywords from the text.
- **Citation Generation**: Formats and generates citations in various styles.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: For text processing and analysis.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing HTML content.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to fetch research papers.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krishna18062005/Research-Paper-Summary-Project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Research-Paper-Summary-Project
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   *Note: Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.*

## Usage

After running the application, you can input the URL of a research paper, and the tool will fetch the content, process it, and provide a summary along with extracted keywords and a formatted citation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or additional features:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch:
